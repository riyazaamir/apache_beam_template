Google Dataflow is a fully-managed service that supports the deployment and management of Apache Beam ETL distributed pipelines. Its autoscaling feature dynamically adjusts resources to cater to varying workloads, optimizing performance and cost-effectiveness.

#### Key Features
- **Managed Service**: Google Dataflow handles infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and scaling, removing the need for manual intervention.
- **Autoscaling**[Disabled for this Use Case]: Dynamically adjusts the number of worker instances in line with the workload, promoting resource efficiency.
- **Dataflow Jobs**: Refers to Apache Beam pipelines executed and managed automatically on the Dataflow service.
